	<h1><strong>Tension on a cable</strong></h1>
	<p>A 200-pound object is to be hung from the end of a rigid 8- foot horizontal pole of negligible weight,
		as shown in the figure below. The pole is attached to a wall by a pivot and is supported by an 8-foot
		cable that is attached to the wall at a higher point. The tension on this cable is given by the equation</p>
    
	<p>$$ T = \frac {W*lc*lp}{d \sqrt {lp^2-d^2}} $$ </p>
    
	<p>where \( T \) is the tension on the cable, \( W \) is the weight of the object, \( lc \) is the length of the cable,\( lp \) is
		the length of the pole,  and \( d \) is the distance along the pole at which the cable is attached.</p>
